## Unit Test with googletest
This is a very raw note about adding unit test for C++.
### Environment Setting
Download zip from [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest)
and unzip the file.

Get into googletest folder, and then
```
$ cd googletest/make
$ make
```
it will produce a `gtest_main.a` file in `googletest/make` folder.

Copy `make` and `include` two folders into your project folder. Now the top two layer of these repo will be like below.
```
.
├── BigNumber
│   ├── BigNumber.h
│   └── main.cpp
├── BigNumber.xcodeproj
├── README.md
└── googletest
    ├── include
    └── make
```

Add library dependency:

1. add `${PROJECT_DIR}/googletest/include` into Header Search Paths

1. add `${PROJECT_DIR}/googletest/make` into Library Search Paths

1. add `gtest_main.a` into Link Binary with Libraries


### Writing Test
Create `BigNumber_spec.h` under `BigNumber`.
Now the top two layer of these repo will be like below.
```
.
├── BigNumber
│   ├── BigNumber.h
│   ├── BigNumber_spec.h
│   └── main.cpp
├── BigNumber.xcodeproj
├── README.md
└── googletest
    ├── include
    └── make
```

In `BigNumber_spec.h`, write
```c++
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
#include "BigNumber.h"


TEST(BigNumberTest, Bigger){
  BigNumber a(2), b(5);
  EXPECT_TRUE(b > a);
}
```
This is a simple example to do unit test, which tests the logical operator `>`.
